        <h1>Welcome to my personal page. I am a Georgia Tech graduate with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. 
            My focus within my degree is in cybersecurity and information internetworks.
            In my program, I have primarily worked in malware reverse engineering and analysis, computer systems security, and network security. 
            These areas of interest have given me extensive coding practice to automate tasks, identify system vulnerabilities,
            and visualize the behavior of malware.
